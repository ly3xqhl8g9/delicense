    Dispersal Framework for Delicensed Data
</h3>



The `delicense` is meant to state the radical openness of the associated `data`.

Through `data` a wide array of entities are covered: from source code or other types of files, to schematics and recipes of software and/or hardware, to actual database contents.

The `delicense` scaffolds an opt-in royalty-like payment system, where an user of the `delicense`, a `delicensor`, is free to choose if they want to pay-back 1% of their winnings to the pooled delicense owners.

Anyone depending on the delicensed data can choose to reward
the delicense owner with 1%. The user of the delicense, the delicensor,
is free to consider however the 1% is computed, the nature of the payments,
one-time, monthly or yearly payments, or any other aspect deemed relevant. If
the delicensor uses multiple delicenses, the 1% shall be split across all the
used delicenses, considering each owner only once.

The delicensing payments are not a mechanism for revenue generation, but for justified recognition and positive feedback strengthening.

A `delicense` consists of the `LICENSE` text (`SHA1:2e49c6c58bb15484f231a7759f85aeed845ee883`) and the `LICENSE.deon` configuration file.

The `delicense` considers the present time and the current data from the stance of the far future where data generation and transformation is costless, hence why the inequality of considering all delicense owners and all delicensed data as of equal value is a feature, it allows for the stability of the entire system.

The `delicense-analyzer` is a Command-Line Interface tool to detect from the root of a directory all the delicense owners upon which the package depends on.



## Digression: On the Antonym of Legal

The antonym of legal is not illegal. The law, `loi`, `lex`, is that which binds and bounds, that which constrains, obligatorily with force, `gewalt`. The antonym of legal is that which sets free, which dissipates and disperses, distributing without dividing. The antonym of legal is dispersal.

A dispersal view stands against a legal act. The legality is grounded and grounds the real. The dispersality floats above and beyond the legal.

Dispersal contexts have no recourse to enforce the dispersion: there can be no state of and for dispersality, no courts to reign in.

Dispersion does not afford the semantic universe of the judicial as it's counterpart, the legal system, can and does; therefore it must be content with being penaltyless: resting outside observance.

Dispersality has no intake, whereas legality is only intake: effect, consequence, causation, implication.
