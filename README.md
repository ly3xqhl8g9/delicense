    Legal Framework for Delicensed Data
</h3>



The `delicense` is meant to state the radical openness of the associated data.

The `delicense` scaffolds an opt-in royalty-like payment system, where an user of the `delicense`, a `delicensor`, is free to choose if they want to pay-back 1% of their winnings to the pooled delicense owners.

The delicensing payments are not a mechanism for revenue generation, but for justified recognition and positive feedback strengthening.

A `delicense` consists of the `DELICENSE` text (`SHA1:b58bc148d5af897f5e72045cc73cd614c6869100`) and the `DELICENSE.deon` configuration file.

The `delicense` considers the present time and the current data from the stance of the far future where data generation and transformation is costless, hence why the inequality of considering all delicense owners as of equal value is a feature, it allows the stability of the entire system.
