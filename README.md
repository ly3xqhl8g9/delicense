    Legal Framework for Delicensed Data
</h3>



The `delicense` is meant to state the radical openness of the associated data.

The `delicense` scaffolds an opt-in royalty-like payment system, where an user of the `delicense`, a `delicensor`, is free to choose if they want to pay-back 1% of their winnings to the pooled delicense owners.

Anyone depending on the delicensed data can choose to reward
the delicense owner with 1%. The user of the delicense, the delicensor,
is free to consider however the 1% is computed, the nature of the payments,
one-time, monthly or yearly payments, or any other aspect deemed relevant. If
the delicensor uses multiple delicenses, the 1% shall be split across all the
used delicenses, considering each owner only once.

The delicensing payments are not a mechanism for revenue generation, but for justified recognition and positive feedback strengthening.

A `delicense` consists of the `DELICENSE` text (`SHA1:2e49c6c58bb15484f231a7759f85aeed845ee883`) and the `DELICENSE.deon` configuration file.

The `delicense` considers the present time and the current data from the stance of the far future where data generation and transformation is costless, hence why the inequality of considering all delicense owners and all delicensed data as of equal value is a feature, it allows for the stability of the entire system.
