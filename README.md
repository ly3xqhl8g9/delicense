    Legal Framework for Delicensed Data
</h3>



The `delicense` is meant to state the radical openness of the associated data.

The `delicense` scaffolds an opt-in royalty-like payment system, where an user of the `delicense`, a `delicensor`, is free to choose if they want to pay-back 1% of their winnings to the pooled delicense owners.

The delicensing payments are not a mechanism for revenue generation, but for justified recognition and positive feedback strengthening.

A `delicense` consists of the `DELICENSE` text (SHA1:b58bc148d5af897f5e72045cc73cd614c6869100) and the `DELICENSE.deon` configuration file.
